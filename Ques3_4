3     Create a class called "Book" with the following data members:
title (string)
author (string)
ISBN (string)
price (double)
stock (int)
In the main function, create an instance of the Book class and initialize its data members. 
Then, use the fstream library to open a file for writing and write the contents of the Book object to the file in binary format.


4     Write a program that reads the contents of a file containing Book objects and prints them to the console. 
The program should use the fstream library to open the file, read the Book objects one at a time, and print their title, author, ISBN, price and stock to the console.
